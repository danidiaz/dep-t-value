- the built-in [`Paths_pkgname` mechanism for accessing data files from package code](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cabal-package.html#accessing-data-files-from-package-code).

- the [data-files](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cabal-package.html#pkg-field-data-files) cabal field.

    > If you decide to import the Paths_pkgname module then it must be listed
    > in the other-modules field just like any other module in your package and
    > on autogen-modules as the file is autogenerated.

- the [data-dir](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cabal-package.html#pkg-field-data-dir) cabal field.
